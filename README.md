**DATA DESCRIPTION**
_______
The dataset (in .npy format) used to train the models and for inverse design is labeled as:


**input_train_data.npy** - the input train data that contains 8,500 laser processing parameters (power, speed, spacing) (3D) 

**output_train_data.npy** - the output train data that contains 8,500 emissivity curves (822D)

**input_test_data.npy** - the input test data that contains 3,259 laser processing parameters (power, speed, spacing) (3D) 

**output_test_data.npy** - the output test data that contains 3,259 emissivity curves (822D)

The data was previously shuffled and split so these four train and test data files can be used in the same way as it is described in the manuscript.
For the inverse models, the inputs and outputs are switched.
_______
**MODELS DESCRIPTION**
_______
The **pretrained_models** folder contains (in .pkl format) both the forward and inverse-trained RF scikit-learn models as well as the PCA compression models.

The forward models trained with varied train dataset sizes (2,500, 5,000, 8,500):
forwardModel_2500_RF 
forwardModel_5000_RF 
forwardModel_8500_RF 

The inverse models (N=20 estimators) trained with varied train dataset sizes (2,500, 5,000, 8,500):
inverseModel_2500_RF 
inverseModel_5000_RF 
inverseModel_8500_RF 

The PCA models (50 principal components) trained with varied train dataset sizes (2,500, 5,000, 8,500):
pca_50_2500 
pca_50_5000 
pca_50_8500 

Models with the same dataset sizes should be used together (i.e. forwardModel_2500_RF with inverseModel_2500_RF and pca_50_2500)
